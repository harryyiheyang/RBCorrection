Title: Winner's Curse Removal by using Rao-Blackwellization for Univariable and Multivariable Mendelian Randomization
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Yihe Yang
Maintainer: Yihe Yang <yxy1234@case.edu>
Description: 
    This package provides functions for removing winner's curse bias in both univariable and multivariable Mendelian Randomization (MR) studies, by using Rao-Blackwellization. 
    It implements methods including randomized instrument selection, Rao-Blackwellization, and re-randomized IVW (RIVW) estimators, as described in Ma, Wang, and Wu (2023, Annals of Statistics).
    The package supports downstream MR estimation using corrected SNP-exposure effect estimates and standard errors, improving statistical validity in settings with weak instruments or selection bias.
